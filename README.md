# Coursera-getting-and-cleaning-data-project
Final course project for Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera

The R script 'run_analysis.R' does the following:

1. Downloads and unzips the dataset
2. Loads the training and test datasets
3. Loads the features and activity labels
4. Applies the appropriate column names to the training and test datasets
5. Merges the two datasets
6. Extracts the mean and standard deviation
7. Applies activity names to the dataset
8. Creates a second, tidy dataset with the mean of each variable for each subject and activity

End result is the file 'second_tidy_dataset.txt'
